## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Credentials Storage**
   - Currently stored in localStorage
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT secure for production
   - Recommendation: Move to server-side environment variables

2. **API Keys**
   - Gemini API key exposed client-side
   - Recommendation: Proxy through backend API route
   - Rate limiting recommended

3. **Neo4j Connection**
   - Uses encrypted connection (neo4j+s://)
   - Credentials transmitted over HTTPS
   - Session management needed for multi-user

---

## üìö Next Steps (Post-Deployment)

1. **Production Hardening**
   - Move credentials to environment variables
   - Implement backend API proxy for Gemini
   - Add rate limiting
   - Set up authentication/authorization

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Batch processing for multiple files
   - Custom entity type definitions
   - Feedback loop UI for corrections
   - Export to multiple formats (CSV, GraphML)
   - Real-time collaboration features

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for repeated queries
   - Add pagination for large result sets
   - Optimize graph rendering for large datasets
   - Add background processing for large files

4. **Analytics Integration**
   - Track extraction accuracy over time
   - Monitor system performance
   - User behavior analytics
   - Error tracking and reporting

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Toast notifications not showing
**Solution:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Sonner component added to layout

### Issue: Neo4j encryption error
**Solution:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Automatic encryption detection based on URI scheme

### Issue: Graph not displaying
**Solution:** 
- Check if data exists in localStorage
- Try "Load from Neo4j" button
- Verify Neo4j credentials
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: File extraction failing
**Solution:**
- Check file format (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, JSON)
- Verify file size < 10MB
- Check browser console for specific error
- Try copying text manually instead
